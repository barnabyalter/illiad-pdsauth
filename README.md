# PDSAuth 64

This project contains the source code and the installer for an ISAPI filter which uses PDS to authenticate users in ILLiad.

This application was built from the base CASAuthN developed at UC Davis, which uses CAS instead of PDS for single sign on:

* PDSAuth - Visual Studio project and source code
* PDSAuth Installer - msi for installing the ISAPI filter

This application has been shown to work in Windows 2008 64-bit environments with IIS 7.5
